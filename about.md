### What is this blog?

This blog about current problems I am working to fix and should be used as a reference point for future projects.

### Why I built this blog?

I built this blog to maintain a current project issue talking points and problems I am having.
This website will enable me to look back on fixes and see what has gone wrong and what I should do to fix these problems.
This blog will also act as a starting point for the way I setup and build most of my projects.

### Who is this blog for?

This blog is built for developers and people who may need to fix a problem I have once faced.
