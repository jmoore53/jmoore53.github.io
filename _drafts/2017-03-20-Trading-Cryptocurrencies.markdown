## What is a Cryptocurrency

A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange like normal currencies such as USD, but designed for the purpose of exchanging digital information through a process made possible by certain principles of cryptography. 

A cryptocurrency is a digital form of currency.

There are many types of crpyptocurrencies based on different technologies, all have a 'blockchain' or common ledger where all transactions are recorded and stored. 
The security of the cryptocurrency ledgers is based on the assumption that the majority of miners are honestly trying to maintain the ledger, having financial incentive to do so. 
This means third parties who maintain the ledgers control how secure the ledger is. 
The ledger is used to record all transactions made.

Most Cryptocurrencies have a [proof-of-work scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) based usually on total computing time to ensure the ledger is being supported properly by third parties. 
The proof-of-work schemes are used to deter denial of service attacks and spam on a network. 
Proof-of-work schemes just ensure the work being completed by the third party 'transaction-confirmer' is correct and being completed by the user who says they are confirming the transactions.
These proof-of-work systems are based on the SHA-256 cryptographic hashing function.
