## Relational Database Management Systems

A [Relational Database Management System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database_management_system) is a database management system based on the relational model. 
They are commonly used for storing information such as financial records, manufacturing and logistics information, personal data, and other applications.
They have largely replaced [heirarchal databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hierarchical_database_model) and [network databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_model) for usability and because they are often easier to understand. 

## Structured Query Language

[SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL) is the domain specific language used in programming and designing relational database management systems.
It is the language used for MySQL and Postgresql. 
The standard uses a large set of features but despite such standards, most SQL code is not completely portable among different database systems.
